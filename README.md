# School Management System

This project is a **C#** desktop application designed to simplify the management of school operations. This system enables **Admin**, **Teachers**, and **Students** to interact with the application through tailored interfaces for efficient record-keeping, attendance management, and result tracking.

## Note:

- The full project, including all dependencies and resources, is not uploaded due to its large size. Instead, this repository contains:
 - **Source Code:** The main application code. 
 - **Screenshots:** A folder with images showcasing the application's interface and functionality. [Screenshots](https://github.com/Gebre-Git/School-Management-System/blob/main/App%20Demo%20Image)
 - **Demo Video:** A video demonstrating the application in action. [Watch it on YouTube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0z36NpjDwmY&t=2s)  

### Admin
- **Registration**: Add new students and teachers to the system.
- **Search**: Search for students and teachers by multiple criteria.
- **Attendance Management**: Track student attendance.
- **Roster Creation**: Create and manage class rosters.
- **Delete Records**: Remove student or teacher records from the system.

### Teachers
- **Set Attendance**: Log attendance for students in each class.
- **Input Results**: Record academic results for students.

### Students
- **View Results**: Students can log in to view their academic results.

## Business Logic

### Admin Role:
- The **Admin** can register students and teachers by entering necessary details into the system, which are stored in an **SQLite** database.
- The Admin can search for users using various criteria (e.g., by name or ID) and view their details.
- Admin can manage attendance by marking or updating the records for each student.
- Rosters can be created and updated, allowing the Admin to assign students to classes.
- Admin has the ability to delete student or teacher records, which also removes their associated data from the system.

### Teacher Role:
- **Teachers** can log in to their interface to mark student attendance. This updates the attendance record in the system.
- Teachers can input results for students, which are then saved in the database and made available to students for viewing.

### Student Role:
- **Students** can log in to view their results. This is a read-only interface where students can only see their academic performance.

The system's data is stored and retrieved from an **SQLite** database, ensuring smooth and efficient record management.

## Technologies Used
